# tethered-pair
Development code for Tethered Pair Algorithm

## Notes
1. For Basic visualization I use FabricJs
2. For Geometry I use PtsJs
3. Gap String sorting did not do good. We check if the polygon is empty

## Todo
1. ~~Limit Obstacles to the ones inside or partially inside the bounding box~~
2. ~~Not all Entities need rendering (Fix Entity to accept a bool for rendering)~~
3. Model.reset()
4. fabric.Point @types is wrong for eq, lt, gt, etc. (create a PR)
